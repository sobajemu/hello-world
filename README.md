# hello-world
A first Java program to display 'hello world' to the output

My name is Sunday Obajemu. I am a construction architect trying to make a carrier branch into software design.
I have learnt programming informally in several languages(C, C+, C++, Java, Basic, etc) on an on-and-off basis for a long time so now I want to put my training on a more solid footing by going through the MIT OCW documents which has refered me to Git as one of the required courses.
